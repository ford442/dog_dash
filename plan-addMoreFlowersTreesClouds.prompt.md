## Plan: Add More Flowers, Trees, and Clouds

### TL;DR
Increase the density of flowers, trees, and clouds in the scene by raising the spawn counts in the population loops in `main.js`.
Imagine some new flowering foliage types.

### Steps
1. **Increase Foliage Count**: Change the foliage loop from 400 to 600.
2. **Increase Flowering Trees**: Change from 25 to 40.
3. **Increase Regular Trees**: Change from 30 to 50.
4. **Increase Mushrooms**: Change from 20 to 30.
5. **Increase Clouds**: Change from 15 to 25.
6. **Increase Glowing Flowers**: Change from 20 to 30.
7. **Increase Floating Orbs**: Change from 15 to 25.
8. **Increase Vines**: Change from 10 to 15.

### Further Considerations
1. Ensure performance remains good with the increased counts.
2. Perhaps adjust the spread areas if needed.
